        <h2>Experiences</h2>
        <h3>Phi Gamma Nu - Delta Phi Chapter</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I am a member of Phi Gamma Nu Professional Business Fraternity at the University of Michigan. I successfully completed the new member education requirements and was initiated in April 2022. As a new member, I ran for brotherhood Philanthropy Chair and beat the incumbant to hold the position for Fall 2022. In Winter 2023, I was a member of the User Experience Design Committee, where I worked with other designers to conduct research for a potential website redesign. In April 2022, I ran for and won the Risk Management Chair position which I will hold for the Fall 2023 term.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Walt Whitman High School Student Government</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I was a member of my high school's Student Government Organization my Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years of high school. All three of those years I served as the chair of the blood drive committee, coordinating our school's biannual blood drive and collecting over 204 units of blood during my term. I was also the founder and chair of the Icebreaker 5K race, which raised over $25,000 during my 2 years as chair benefitting Children's National Medical Center and has continued to be an annual event since my graduation. The SGA as a whole also spearheaded other fundraising initiatives for Children's National Medical Center and American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, as well as created meaningful mental health disussions that we led for students biannually.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Black & White, Student Newspaper</h3>
        <br>
        <p>As both a writer and section editor for my school's student newspaper, I honed my writing and journalism skills that I still draw on today in my college classes. During my time as a writer I wrote for the sports section, writing an expository article on one of our school's most violent rivalries, winning a "best of S.N.O award" (Student News Organization) for the piece. As an editor, I oversaw current junior writers helping them improve their story-pitching skills and editing their work with them repeatedly to create great products.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Georgetown Aquatics</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The past 4 summers I've worked a lifeguard for Palisades Swim & Tennis Club through Georgetown Aquatics. Consistently working 30+ hours per week, I grew to be the head lifeguard during my last 2 years and a leader to the younger and newer guards on our staff. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked to implement and withhold health and safety guidelines that allowed the pool to remain open and offer a safe outlet outdoors for members to work out and enjoy family time as usual, even during a difficult time.</p>
